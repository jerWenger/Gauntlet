# Gauntlet
This is the code created for our Gauntlet project.

The main folder contains three subfolders that house each section of our code. 

Scan and make map: This is the code to have the neato run scans of the gauntlet and then format it into a plot that is rotated to the global frame

Simulation: This folder contains the final code needed to have the neato run its gradient descent in the gauntlet

Create plots and equation: This folder contains the main file that generates our equation for our field and generate the plots needed for the report.
